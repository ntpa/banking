# banking

**Capital One bank statements (.csv) analyzer.**

README is under construction. Currently, the C executable is used to generate an output file, which is used by the C++ executable as input.

Assuming all files in src/ in the same directory compile and build executable in Linux(**Debian**) with:

```
g++ -Wall -Wextra entry.c statement_list.cpp main.cpp -o bankingcpp
```

Please stay tuned.
